### mcu-tool-script.

- Script used to compile the latest version of the former MC-U Tool, a software used for repairing mobile phones. 

- This script is intended for educational purposes only. However, it is worth noting that some important exploit and resource files are missing from the process, so the script will not compile.

- The tool is created using AutoIT. For security reasons, several processes have been created using exploits made in C# and called by the tool in AutoIT. Additionally, many important codes are stored in the database and are called by the tool during execution.

- Communication with the database is managed by PHP files stored on the server, which work as an API.
